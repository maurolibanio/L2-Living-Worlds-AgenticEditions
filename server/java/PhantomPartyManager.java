/**
 * Recruited combat-party brain.
 * <p>
 * When a real player shouts an LFM/LFP, {@link FakePlayerChatManager} parses the wanted roles and calls
 * {@link #recruitFromShout}. For each open slot this manager spawns a level-matched combat phantom of that role
 * (via {@link PhantomManager#spawnPartyMember}) a little way off, out of sight, then walks it to the player and
 * has it ask for an invite - so it reads as a real player who saw the shout and jogged over, not an NPC popping
 * into existence. The invite is auto-accepted server-side ({@code RequestJoinParty} -> {@link #onInvited}).
 * <p>
 * Once partied, a member follows the leader and (default) <b>assists</b> the leader's target - the party focus-
 * fires together; an "attack freely" order flips it to hunt nearby mobs on its own. Healers heal the hurt party
 * member and raise the dead; buffers keep the whole party buffed. Everything is rule-based and works with the
 * LLM brain offline; free-form orders fall through to the brain for a natural reply only when it is online.
